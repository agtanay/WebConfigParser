Step to run-

•	Open command prompt

•	python filename “filepath”

Blockers-

•	if a directory or subdirectory does not have “web.config” file it will throw an error in the console. Recommend to copy all files in separate folders and run the parser.
•	If a web.config file has a single tag repeated multiple times parser will throw false positives.
